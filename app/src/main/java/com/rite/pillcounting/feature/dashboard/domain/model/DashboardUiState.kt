/**
 * Represents the aggregated UI state for the Dashboard screen.
 *
 * This data class encapsulates both static dashboard metrics and dynamic states such as
 * user detail loading, error handling, navigation flags, and authentication-related feedback.
 *
 * All count values are [String] because they are intended for direct UI display.
 * The user detail is retrieved from the API and stored as a nullable [UserDetail] object.
 *
 * @property completedFixedCount Number of completed fixed count tasks.
 * @property partialFixedCount Number of in-progress or partial fixed count tasks.
 * @property completedRegularCount Number of completed regular count tasks.
 * @property partialRegularCount Number of in-progress or partial regular count tasks.
 * @property isLoadingUserDetail Whether the user detail API is currently loading.
 * @property userDetailError Error message from user detail fetch operation, if any.
 * @property userDetail Authenticated user's profile detail.
 * @property navigateToProfile Navigation flag to redirect user to profile completion screen
 *                              if their profile is incomplete or missing required fields.
